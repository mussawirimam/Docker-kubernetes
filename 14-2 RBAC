Role based access control, 
in our cluster we can create namespaces. 
In our cluster, we have different application teams and everyone is working on different applications. It is not possible for me to give seperate cluster for each of the teams.
I dont want to give them five different servers for the dev environment or UAT etc. So, what I will do is I will create in my cluster a logical space. So that each team can have the access to that logcial space. 


----------------------
| Dev | UAT | app-POC|
|     |     |        |
|     |     |        |
----------------------

So, how we can create these logical spaces? we are already having logical spaces like namespaces in our cluster. 
but with RBAC you get much more capabilities

lets check the namespaces in k8s
