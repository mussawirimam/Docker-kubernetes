###  how do you download the packages on linux? 
through tar files
through curl 
through apt on debain or yum/dnf on the fedora based linux 

apt-install apache2 -y 
  if you are downloading through the tar file then you will be sorting everything. Example: 
  you will be downloading the daemons and starting them and their services binaries and the dependencies, you will have to take care of all the steps 
but with the apt install apache -y all the dependencies are already places in the repositories and are resolved with just one command to install the apache

package installers makes the installation process easy. 
Similarly in the k8s, to deploy our application we are making so many types of the yaml files to deploy the application. 
You might be having 
deployment.yaml
config.yaml
secret.yaml
ingress.yaml 
serviceclusterIp.yaml
just few I am talking about for example, when you are talking about on the enterprise level there will be so many of the yaml files. 

Now thing that you want to deploy an application in one of the environment. I want to install currently in UAT
I already tested in Dev environment and I want to deploy into the UAT environment, I can keep this yaml file on the centralized repository on the github,
I can just do the git clone, then I will do something like 

kubectl create -f . 
Now after sometime, I want to move it to the Prod or some other environment, I will be calling this from the centralized repository gitclone 
and re-apply

you know what happens is that, in different environments we might need different settings and the process above might not work. 
example in DEV I have different requirements like different cpu memory replica environment in DEV and UAT I might have different requirements. 


In Pre-Prod I might have different requirements that I will have to do. 
If this is the case 

It will be problamatic if I have different environments and each environment have different requirements,
and for each environments I will have to keep seperate repositories and same file 
in this case it will cause a lot of issues. And if there are secrets involved then I cant keep them on the repositories. I will have to dynamically define the values.
