### how to install

## how your jenkins is going and creating this deployment in a k8s cluster 
# whenever we are implementing the ci/cd pipeline how things works over there
first you will do the gitclone --> codetest --> maven build --> docker-image --> push-img repo --> (CD) deploy latest build in k8s cluster

### jenkins will be having access of the k8s cluster, then only it will be replacing that existing deployment
# lets assume that someone hacked the jenkins, if your jenkins is compromised that means that your complete cluster will be compromised
just to make secure the CD part, we seperate the process of CD through ARGOCD or Bmaboot
