### so far we have seen the services as 
cluster ip 
nodeport 
loadbalancer

### what is the use of the ingress?
to access your application from outside of the cluster. 
Assume that, I want to access kubernetes outside of the cluster but the thing is that, I want to access it through the domain name. 
So, if you are using the nodeport or loadbalancer..

youll have to use the combination of the ip and port 
Its not a good idea to tell your client visit the application on the this ip address, they will not be able to remember that. 
even if you using the loadbalancer, you might be getting the fqdn or something. Again your client will not be able to remember complex fqdns.
but your client can remember the domain name like google.com 
### how to access th
Nodeport: 192.168.1.20:30123 
LB: 192.168.1.20:30123 or fqdn like example abcd.azmazonaws.com
