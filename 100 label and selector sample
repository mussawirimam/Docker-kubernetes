In Kubernetes (k8s), labels and selectors are fundamental concepts used to organize and manage resources. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

Labels
------
Labels are key-value pairs that are attached to objects like pods, services, and deployments.
They provide metadata that helps identify and organize resources.
Labels are used to select objects and group them based on criteria like environment, app version, or release stage.

Example of labels:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: newpod
  labels:             <-----------------------<<< LABEL
    app: myapp
spec:
  containers:
    - name: con1
      image: nginx:latest
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80

Selectors
---------
Selectors are used to filter and select a group of objects based on their labels. There are two types of selectors:

- Equality-based selectors: Match labels with specific key-value pairs.
- Set-based selectors: Match labels that fit within a specific set of values.

Example of a selector in a service:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: newpod-svc
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:            <-----------------------<<< SELECTOR
    app: myapp
  ports:
    - port: 80
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: 30122
