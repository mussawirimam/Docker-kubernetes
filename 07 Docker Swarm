## if one container is crashed and replica container needs to be spun up by itself, docker itself cant do it alone. You will need a mechanism such as Docker Swarm or Kubernetes. To make your container highly available. 
## you have to define if the load is increasing on your server (container) how many maximum or minumum containers should spin up based on your CPU utilization (Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)) in your cluster. 

Manager/Lead Node 
We can have multiple manager nodes 
If we have multiple manager nodes, we will have a leader of them who will be taking the decisions.
max 7 manager but no limit but one has to be leader node

Worker Nodes
We can have multiple worker nodes
Job of a worker node is to get deployed your containers in it, your worker nodes. 
In docker swarm allows the containers to be deployed on the managers or leaders as well. 


Assume that your manager is getting down. Always create even number of nodes that can be in groups of 4,6,8

If you have 3 containers with 2 managers and 1 leader, and both managers are down, the leader will not be able to make a decision if you request the creation of a deployment with 3 replicas (of containers), because the managers are responsible 
for managing the worker nodes and it will not know in which one to place the worker nodes. If you have 4 worker nodes for example. If you want it to be working, you will need to reset the manager 

#########################################
# docker swarm init --force-new-cluster #
#########################################

In this case where multiple manager node are down one eader will not be able to take decision in this situation we need
To create new cluster
#docker swarm init --force-new-cluster
Here your node will be having already information of worker node, your swarm services will continue to run.
Promote existing worker to manager node #docker node promote {node-name}
All worker node will be having your deployment in it. U can disable deployment in manager node #docker node update - -availability drain {node-name}

If multiple node is down
Suggestion: always create even number of nodes that can be divided in groups 4,6,8
