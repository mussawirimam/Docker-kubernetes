### im having multiple applications running in my cluster and a database
these application uses backend database. I can create a networking rule, which says that who can talk to these application
we will learn a simple networking rule implementation. Based on the labels, the network policies will be implemented

################################## CNI BEGINS ##################################
###
if you are thinking to implement networking rule, where wp1 is only talk to DB. 
we need to implement the network policy 
these network policies will be working with few of the CNI image cluster creation


### some widely CNI's are Calico, Cilium, and WeaveNet.
### are few of the plugins which supports Network Policies
# flannel is also a CNI and it will allow you to create the network policy but it will not work. Becareful which CNI you use. 
# Calico and Cilium is most widely used 
# WeaveNet is lightweight
### we have deployed calico here

### DENY ALL INGRESS
### we will not apply this policy but this policy denies any incoming (ingress) traffic to your cluster
### we will not apply this but this is the code below 
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default-deny-ingress
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress


### DENY ALL EGRESS
### we will not apply this policy but this policy denies any out going (egress) traffic to your cluster
### we will not apply this but this is the code below 
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default-deny-egress
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Egress

### if you are implementing the Deny all Egress policy on node, pods inside your that particular node will node be able to communicate.
In this case you will have to implement the network policy on each pod whenever you are deploying stating about the egress and ingress communication. 
example: wp1 has egress and db will have the ingress so that the db will be able to listen to the traffic coming from the wp1
if db wants to send traffic to the wp1 and if there is no policy for ingress, then the wp1 will block the traffic. For this reason, we will need to implement the ingress policy 
on the wp1 pod as well.
short: both the pods will need ingress and egress policies on both sides for incoming traffic and outgoing traffic (inbound/outbound) to be able to communicate with each other. 

egress        ingress
      ------->
wp1            db
      <-------
ingress       egress
