how to resolve this in ubuntu 23.4 in my parallels Found multiple CRI endpoints on the host. Please define which one do you wish to use by setting the 'criSocket' field in the kubeadm configuration file: unix:///var/run/containerd/containerd.sock, unix:///var/run/crio/crio.sock
To see the stack trace of this error execute with --v=5 or higher

The error occurs because Kubernetes detected multiple Container Runtime Interfaces (CRIs) on the host, and it needs a specific CRI socket to be defined in the kubeadm configuration file. Here’s how to resolve this issue by specifying the criSocket in your kubeadm configuration:

Solution Steps:
---------------
1st step 
Determine the Desired CRI Socket:
Decide which container runtime you want to use: containerd or cri-o.
 
  The available sockets are: 
containerd: unix:///var/run/containerd/containerd.sock
cri-o: unix:///var/run/crio/crio.sock

2nd step 
Create or Modify the Kubeadm Configuration File:
Create a kubeadm configuration file if you don’t have one. You can name it kubeadm-config.yaml.
Add the criSocket field to specify the CRI you want to use.
 
  Here’s an example configuration to use containerd:

vi kubeadm-config.yaml
apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta3
kind: InitConfiguration
nodeRegistration:
  criSocket: unix:///var/run/containerd/containerd.sock

Alternatively, to use cri-o, specify:

nodeRegistration:
  criSocket: unix:///var/run/crio/crio.sock

3rd step 
Initialize Kubeadm Using the Configuration File:
Run the kubeadm init command with the configuration file:

sudo kubeadm init --config=kubeadm-config.yaml

4th step 
Verify the Setup:
Ensure that the cluster is initialized and the nodes are using the correct container runtime by checking the CRI socket:

kubectl describe node <node-name> | grep -i "Container Runtime"

I am using crio, so I am going to stop containerd
sudo systemctl stop containerd
sudo systemctl disable containerd

if crio is not installed then follow these steps from GITHUB
